  3. Take three numbers from the user and print the greatest number. [GreatestThree.java](https://github.com/TEJ-1-8/JAVA_Programs/blob/main/greatest.java)
  4. Program that keeps a number from the user and generates an integer between 1 and 7 and displays the name of the weekday. [Weekday.java](https://github.com/TEJ-1-8/JAVA_Programs/blob/main/Weekday.java)
  5. Program that reads in two floating-point numbers and tests whether they are the same up to three decimal places. [FloatingDigit.java](https://github.com/TEJ-1-8/JAVA_Programs/blob/main/Comp2FPN.java)
  6. Program that takes a year from user and print whether that year is a leap year or not. [LeapYear.java](https://github.com/TEJ-1-8/JAVA_Programs/blob/main/LeapYear.java)
  7. Program to display the first 10 natural numbers. [FirstnNatural.java](https://github.com/TEJ-1-8/JAVA_Programs/blob/main/Natural.java)
  8. Program to input 5 numbers from keyboard and find their sum and average. [SumAverage.java](https://github.com/TEJ-1-8/JAVA_Programs/blob/main/SumAvg.java)
  9. Program in Java to display the multiplication table of a given integer. [MultiplicationTable.java](https://github.com/TEJ-1-8/JAVA_Programs/blob/main/TableOfANumber.java)
  10. Program in Java to display the pattern like right angle triangle with a number. [PrintPattern.java](https://github.com/TEJ-1-8/JAVA_Programs/blob/main/RightTriangle.java)

Module-2
  1. Program to read two numbers and perform the arithmetic operations using method. [Arithmetic.java](https://github.com/TEJ-1-8/JAVA_Programs/blob/main/Calculator.java)
  2. Program that performs arithmetic with values of type char. 
  3. Design a class to overload a method compare() to return the greater of two as follows: [Compare.java](https://github.com/TEJ-1-8/JAVA_Programs/blob/main/Greater.java)
